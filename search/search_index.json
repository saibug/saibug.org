Overall, the atmosphere was perfect, and I had the chance to meet some great people (Geeks) from some companies like Redhat, Worteks, Elastic...</p> <p>Pyconfr is an event organized by Afpy once a year, bringing together Python developers and anyone else who wants to discover Python.</p> <p>I took part in a contribution session for Ansible, where the goal was to try to resolve an issue for any Ansible module. ansible-collections</p> <p>The workshop was led by two people, @pilou and @mscherer. He's an idea of the program :</p> <ul> <li>Correction of existing bugs.</li> <li>Reviews of existing pull requests.</li> <li>Correction of unstable tests.</li> <li>Improvement of documentation.</li> <li>Addition of unit tests (tox/mock) and integration tests (docker/lxc).</li> </ul> <p>Another workshop I participated in was creating the CI/CD chain with Nox, and the main goal was to automate the development process with Python via Nox to create flexible test automation.</p> <p>Nox is a tool designed to automate testing on multiple Python environments. It is similar to Tox. However, it uses the standard Python file for its configuration.</p> <p>Here are the prerequisites for completing the exercises : </p> <ul> <li>Laptop: Linux is highly recommended for this type of use, but Windows will also work if you have WSL &amp; pyenv installed.</li> <li>Git configured.</li> <li>An account on GitHub or GitLab.</li> <li>Basic knowledge of the command line (Linux).</li> </ul> <p>The repository is available here : Gitlab-nox</p> <p>Enjoyyyy :) </p>"},{"location":"posts/Vagrant-installing-running/","title":"Vagrant installing running","text":"<p>\u201cVagrant is a versatile tool used by devops engineers, developers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts to create development and testing environments.

This helps to maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.</p> <pre><code>https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/intro\n</code></pre> <p>This guide explains how to get Vagrant running on fedora based system. I started with minimal Fedora install to minimize the host\u2019s memory footprint, but the steps should work on any Fedora setup, whether Server or Workstation.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Verify the machine supports wirtualisation: <pre><code>$ sudo lscpu | grep Virtualization\nVirtualization:                  VT-x\nVirtualization type:             full\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Install qemu-kvm: <pre><code>$ sudo dnf install qemu-kvm libvirt libguestfs-tools virt-install rsync\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Start and enable libvirt daemon: <pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Install Vagrant: <pre><code>$ sudo dnf install vagrant\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Install libvirtd\u2019s plugin: <pre><code>$ sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Add the box: <pre><code>$ vagrant box add fedora/41-cloud-base --provider=libvirt\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Set up environment: <pre><code>$ mkdir vagrant-demo\n$ cd vagrant-demo\n$ vi Vagrantfile\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"fedora/41-cloud-base\"\nend\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Check the file: <pre><code>$ vagrant status\nCurrent machine states:\n\ndefault not created (libvirt)\n\nThe Libvirt domain is not created.
