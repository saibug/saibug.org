Greeting !!

It was a pleasure to attend PyconFR 2025 in Lyon. Overall, the atmosphere was perfect, and I had the chance to meet some great people (Geeks) from some companies like Redhat, Worteks, Elastic...

**Pyconfr** is an event organized by [Afpy](https://www.afpy.org/) once a year, bringing together Python developers and anyone else who wants to discover Python.

I took part in a contribution session for Ansible, where the goal was to try to resolve an issue for any Ansible module. [ansible-collections](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues)

The workshop was led by two people, @pilou and @mscherer. He's an idea of the program :

- Correction of existing bugs.
- Reviews of existing pull requests.
- Correction of unstable tests.
- Improvement of documentation.
- Addition of unit tests (tox/mock) and integration tests (docker/lxc).


Another workshop I participated in was creating the CI/CD chain with Nox, and the main goal was to automate the development process with Python via Nox to create flexible test automation.


_**[Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/tutorial.html)** is a tool designed to automate testing on multiple Python environments. It is similar to Tox. However, it uses the standard Python file for its configuration._

Here are the prerequisites for completing the exercises : 

- Laptop: Linux is highly recommended for this type of use, but Windows will also work if you have WSL & pyenv installed.
- Git configured.
- An account on GitHub or GitLab.
- Basic knowledge of the command line (Linux).

The repository is available here : [Gitlab-nox](https://gitlab.com/littlebigcode/public/atelier-nox-pyconfr-2025)

Enjoyyyy :)
